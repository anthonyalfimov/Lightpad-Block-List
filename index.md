## BLOCKS Playground
*by Brian Wang* | [\[Website\]](https://wangpy.github.io/blocks-playground/) | [\[Source\]](https://github.com/wangpy/blocks-playground)

> This project is developed to provide a more friendly platform to develop programs for ROLI Lightpad Block / Lightpad M devices.
The webpage also acts as a Lightpad Block Simulator. The simulated pad can receive mouse / touch input events to test / play the Javascript code.

## Axyz Gems
*by Joris RÃ¶ling @ Bonboa* | [\[Download\]](https://github.com/jorisroling/axyz-gems/blob/master/Axyz%20Gems.littlefoot) | [\[Article\]](https://github.com/jorisroling/axyz-gems)

> This LittleFoot script will turn a **ROLI Lightpad Block** into a high-res multi XY surface. Multi as in five times... for five fingers... at the same time!

> For every finger (touch) it shows a pulsing (on the beat if available) gem in a bright colour. The position of these  gems are translated into MIDI Control Changes which can be mapped to anything in modern DAW's (Digital Audio Workstations) such as Ableton Live. A setup page on the device itself facilitates the easy creation of this kind of mappings.

> I created this script because I really enjoy the plugins by U-he (Hive & Zebra2 in particular). These plugins have very nice XY controls which I map through Ableton Live (with Absolute 14-bit precision). These plugins also have CC 2 (breath) and CC 11 (expression) mapped as extra controllers, so the first gem (orange) uses these.

## 8-Step MIDI Sequencer
*by Liam Lacey @ AskAudio* | [\[Article & Download\]](https://ask.audio/articles/how-to-hack-roli-lightpad-block-into-an-8step-midi-sequencer)

> A simple 8-step monophonic MIDI step sequencer, which contains: 8 sliders for setting a step's note (from a set scale), or for turning the step off; a slider on the right side for setting the sequence tempo; a button on the top-right corner that, when held, allows you to apply pressure to the note sliders to set the notes velocity.The button the side of the Lightpad starts/stop the sequence. The sequence can also be started/stopped via MIDI start/continue/stop messages.
