## Axyz Gems

*by Joris Röling @ Bonboa* | [\[Download\]](https://github.com/jorisroling/axyz-gems/blob/master/Axyz%20Gems.littlefoot) | [\[Article\]](https://github.com/jorisroling/axyz-gems)

This LittleFoot script will turn a ROLI Lightpad Block into a high-res multi XY surface. Multi as in five times... for five fingers... at the same time!

For every finger (touch) it shows a pulsing (on the beat if available) gem in a bright colour. The position of these  gems are translated into MIDI Control Changes which can be mapped to anything in modern DAW's (Digital Audio Workstations) such as Ableton Live. A setup page on the device itself facilitates the easy creation of this kind of mappings.

I [Joris Röling] created this script because I really enjoy the plugins by U-he (Hive & Zebra2 in particular). These plugins have very nice XY controls which I map through Ableton Live (with Absolute 14-bit precision). These plugins also have CC 2 (breath) and CC 11 (expression) mapped as extra controllers, so the first gem (orange) uses these.

## LDM ROLI Blocks Pack [Paid]

[![LDM ROLI Blocks Pack Playlist](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vV02FiNLysc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4MRxWhueR3w-gSqCAdU0e0xQfbhYkaap)

*by LDM Design* | [\[Buy\]](https://isotonikstudios.com/product/ldm-roli-blocks-pack/) | [\[Video Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4MRxWhueR3w-gSqCAdU0e0xQfbhYkaap)

**Boing Block** is based on a monome device which provides an easy and fun interface for creating polymetric rhythms. It allows for different directional modes for more sequence lengths. The app can run from the Lightpad’s internal clocking ability (which is limited to arbitrary speeds and can’t provide specific BPM values) or by an external clock source. It will also advance once step each time it receives a C-2 note, which can allow for different speeds and odd sequencing.

**Chordset** allows an easy way to trigger chords within a Major or Minor scale. The app responds to Pressure and Slide. There are also modifiers to add the 7th and/or the 9th, and to use different inversions of the chord. Hold the 7th or 9th when striking the chord. The Inversion can be switched between Root, 1st and 2nd inversion.

**Fretpad** app is modeled on the layout and techniques of guitar strings. You can slide up and down the string, hammer on and pull off, as well as take advantage of the MPE pressure and slide features of the blocks. For anyone more familiar with a guitar than a keyboard this app provides an intuitive interface for playing. The last note pressed on any one string will send the pressure and slide value for that string.

**Mod CC** allows the user to build a custom MIDI controller which has 12 customizable slots and 4 sliders. Each slot can hold a switch, pressure pad or a momentary button. Along the bottom row are buttons which open and close a slider, which will open in that column. When the slider is hidden, the colour of the button reflects the value of the slider from green to red.

**Pressure Cafe** is based the a monome device, Press Cafe. The app has 5 different patterns, which can be set with 5 different notes. When the finger is held down on any column, the placement of the finger in the y axis determines what pattern will be used for that note. The pressure value will control the velocity of the notes coming out, although this can also be mapped to aftertouch. Sliding the finger up or down will utilise midi CC 74 for more expressive play.

## LDM ROLI Blocks Pack Two [Paid]

[![LDM ROLI Blocks Pack Playlist](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3MSL1IDcfW8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4MRxWhueR3xW5eWochoOWSGXr64V3bCx)

*by LDM Design* | [\[Buy\]](https://isotonikstudios.com/product/ldm-roli-blocks-pack-two/) | [\[Video Playlist\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4MRxWhueR3xW5eWochoOWSGXr64V3bCx)

**Bjorklund** is a euclidean sequencer with 6 channels. Each channel can have up to 24 steps for the total length. The number of pulses within those steps are spread out as evenly as possible across the sequence according to the Bjorklund euclidean algorithm.

**Chance** is a 16 step, 6 track sequencer which includes mute and solo controls for live manipulation. With this app you can also set the velocity level and the probability for each step. This can allow for evolving and semi-generative patterns within the 16 step sequence.

**Pentagome** is inspired by the Polygome monome device. The app allows instant transposition of up to 5 different programmable sequences. Set to a specific scale, a set pattern can be played from up to 20 different notes, and responds to pressure and slide. Each pattern can then be latched on while preserving the pressure and slide values, while you can play a new pattern on the grid. Each pattern can be set with a dynamic pattern length which can include empty steps.

**Pressulator** is inspired by the Korg Kaossilator. Play through a scale by sliding your finger across the block. As you slide your finger across the X-axis, the notes will play through a scale. The Y-axis will send the slide parameter. The app is designed to be monophonic.

## 8-Step MIDI Sequencer

A simple 8-step monophonic MIDI step sequencer, which contains: 8 sliders for setting a step's note (from a set scale), or for turning the step off; a slider on the right side for setting the sequence tempo; a button on the top-right corner that, when held, allows you to apply pressure to the note sliders to set the notes velocity.The button the side of the Lightpad starts/stop the sequence. The sequence can also be started/stopped via MIDI start/continue/stop messages.
